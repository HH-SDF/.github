# Superior Duct Fabrication – Data Analytics

Our Data Analytics team transforms raw operational and financial data into actionable insights that drive efficiency, inform strategy, and amplify customer value. The repositories collected here support that mission.

## Naming Convention

Our internal repositories bear **single‑word warship codenames**. Each name honors the shipbuilders and steelworkers who shaped naval history—craftsmen whose precision and resilience echo the culture of our own fabrication floor and analytics practice.

### Why Warships?

| Theme                      | Reflection in Our Work                                                                                                                                       |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Manufacturing Heritage** | Warships are monuments of steel fabrication and systems integration—values central to Superior Duct Fabrication.                                             |
| **Resilience Under Fire**  | Vessels like *Intrepid* completed missions despite heavy damage; our data pipelines remain reliable amid changing requirements and imperfect source systems. |
| **Mission Diversity**      | Carriers project power, scout, and rescue; our projects extract, transform, model, and visualize data to support diverse business questions.                 |
| **Continuity of Craft**    | Shipwrights passed hard‑won knowledge across generations; we document and refine analytics patterns to serve future teams.                                   |

### Symbolism in Practice

* **Single Word, Big Story** – A codename is brief in the terminal yet rich in narrative. Whether it’s *Intrepid* recovering Apollo capsules or *Nimitz* sustaining carrier operations for decades, each name reminds us that engineering excellence endures.
* **Readme Tagline** – The first lines of every repository’s README link the hull’s history to the project’s purpose, anchoring newcomers in both technical and cultural context.
* **Living Heritage** – As our analytics stack evolves, codenames stay constant—signposting continuity even when languages, frameworks, or data models change.

### Legacy and Future

Our warship codenames salute the industrial milestones that came before us while reminding every engineer that true craftsmanship is timeless. Each commit is a rivet, every release a sea trial, and every analytic insight a plotted course that keeps Superior Duct Fabrication on target. By carrying these names forward we honor the welders, draftsmen, and sailors whose innovation turned raw steel into mission‑ready capability—and we challenge ourselves to match their standard of excellence.
